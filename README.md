# Splunk Windows Log Analysis Lab

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Splunk Enterprise (Free Trial)
- Windows Event Logs
- EventCode 4625 (Failed Login Events)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Simulate real-world log analysis by detecting failed login attempts (EventCode 4625) on a Windows system using Splunk. This lab demonstrates the ability to search, filter, and visualize system log dataâ€”core skills for security analysts.

## ðŸ§ª What I Did
- Installed Splunk Enterprise on a local Windows machine
- Ingested Windows Event Logs into Splunk via the local event log monitor
- Queried logs using:
  - `index=main EventCode=4625`
  - `index=main EventCode=4625 | stats count by Account_Name`
- Analyzed failed login patterns and created visualizations using the Splunk interface

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- How to identify and investigate Windows login failure events
- Use of Splunk's search language (SPL) to filter and analyze logs
- Recognized that failed logins can originate from system accounts (machine accounts with `$`) in addition to user accounts
- Confirmed that not all failed logins indicate malicious activityâ€”but they can be an early sign of brute-force or misconfigurations

## âœ… Next Steps
- Simulate failed logins from a real user account to enrich dataset
- Explore EventCode 4624 (successful logins)
- Set up basic alerts for multiple failed logins in a short timeframe
